# 🛠️ Full‑Stack Senior Playbook

Welcome! This public repository documents my journey from **intermediate** to **senior‑level** full‑stack engineer while shoring up core CS fundamentals.  
Expect a mix of mini‑projects, in‑depth notes, and infrastructure experiments—everything version‑controlled and visible.
