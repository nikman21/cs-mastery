# 🚀 CS Mastery Curriculum

A comprehensive 17-week computer science curriculum covering modern full-stack development, distributed systems, security, and DevOps practices.

## 📖 What's Inside

This repository contains a production-ready curriculum designed to bridge the gap between academic computer science and industry software engineering.

**Core Focus Areas:**
- 🖥️ Computer Architecture & Fundamentals
- ⚛️ Advanced Full-Stack Development (React, Next.js, GraphQL)
- 🔗 Microservices & Distributed Systems (Go, gRPC, Kafka)
- 🔐 Application Security (OWASP, DevSecOps)
- 🐳 DevOps & CI/CD (Docker, Kubernetes, Observability)
- 🤖 AI Integration & MLOps

## 📚 Curriculum Structure

**Duration:** August 15 – December 13 (17 weeks)

The curriculum is organized into 6 parallel tracks that culminate in an integrated capstone project combining all technologies and practices.
