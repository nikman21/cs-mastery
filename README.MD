# 🛠️ Full-Stack Senior Playbook

Welcome! This public repository documents my journey from **intermediate** to **senior-level** full-stack engineer while shoring up core CS fundamentals.

Expect a mix of mini-projects, in-depth notes, and infrastructure experiments—everything version-controlled and visible.
