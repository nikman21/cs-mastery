## üìù Assessment Criteria

Each week's project will be evaluated on:

- **Correctness:** Does the implementation work as specified?
- **Performance:** Is the solution efficient in time/space?
- **Code Quality:** Clean, readable, well-documented code
- **Understanding:** Can you explain design decisions?
