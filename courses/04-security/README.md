## üìã Course Description

This course focuses on designing, building, and verifying secure web services through practical application of security principles. Students will learn to analyze attack surfaces, implement secure authentication and authorization, validate inputs, protect against common web vulnerabilities, and integrate security testing into development pipelines. The course emphasizes standards-based approaches using OWASP guidelines and real-world security scenarios.

### **Design** (Synthesis)
- [ ] Design tenant-aware role-based access control (RBAC) systems
- [ ] Architect secure session management and state handling
- [ ] Design comprehensive logging and auditing systems
- [ ] Plan secure webhook implementations with verification

### **Implement** (Application)
- [ ] Implement contextual input validation and output encoding
- [ ] Create content security policies (CSP) with nonce/hash directives
- [ ] Build idempotent webhook handlers with signature verification
- [ ] Integrate SAST/DAST tools into CI/CD pipelines

### **Evaluate** (Evaluation)
- [ ] Evaluate CSP trade-offs between security and functionality
- [ ] Assess rate limiting strategies for abuse prevention
- [ ] Review security scan results and prioritize remediation
- [ ] Critique incident response procedures and postmortems

### **Create** (Creation)
- [ ] Create comprehensive threat models for web applications
- [ ] Develop abuse-case tests for security validation
- [ ] Build secure multi-tenant applications with proper isolation
