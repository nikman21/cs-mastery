# üè† Digital Homesteading: Local-First Infrastructure

**Duration:** 12 weeks  
**Goal:** Build a self-sufficient, local-first digital infrastructure using Raspberry Pi 4, Jetson Nano, and open-source tools

## üéØ Course Overview

Transform your home into a digital homestead with local-first services, AI capabilities, and off-grid resilience. This course teaches you to build and maintain your own infrastructure using open-source tools and your existing hardware.

### üõ†Ô∏è Your Hardware Stack
- **Raspberry Pi 4** - Main homelab server
- **Jetson Nano** - Local AI processing
- **Unmanaged network switch** - Network backbone
- **External SSD** - Storage and backups
