# Week 01: DevOps, SDLC, and Version Control for Teams

**Learning Objectives:**
- [ ] Implement Git branching strategies (GitFlow, GitHub Flow)
- [ ] Establish code review workflows and quality gates
- [ ] Set up basic CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- [ ] Configure team collaboration tools and processes
- [ ] Apply DevOps culture principles to development workflow
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation and runbooks

## ðŸŽ¯ Scenario: Modernizing Legacy Development Practices

You've been hired as a DevOps engineer at TechCorp, a mid-size company struggling with deployment delays, code conflicts, and inconsistent releases. The development team currently uses a single main branch with manual deployments, leading to frequent production issues and long release cycles.

Your mission: Transform their development workflow to implement modern DevOps practices, establish proper version control strategies, and set up automated CI/CD pipelines that enable rapid, reliable deployments.

## ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step Tasks

### Task 1: Git Branching Strategy Implementation (2 hours)

#### 1.1 Set up GitFlow Workflow
```bash
# Initialize repository with GitFlow
git flow init -d

# Create feature branch
git flow feature start user-authentication

# Make changes and commit
echo "# User authentication module" > auth.md
git add auth.md
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication module"

# Finish feature branch
git flow feature finish user-authentication
```

#### 1.2 Implement GitHub Flow Alternative
```bash
# Create feature branch from main
git checkout -b feature/payment-integration

# Make changes and commit
echo "# Payment processing" > payment.md
git add payment.md
git commit -m "feat: add payment processing"

# Push and create pull request
git push origin feature/payment-integration
```

### Task 2: Code Review Workflow Setup (1.5 hours)

#### 2.1 Configure Pull Request Templates
Create `.github/pull_request_template.md`:
```markdown
## Description
Brief description of changes

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Breaking change
- [ ] Documentation update

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing completed

## Checklist
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Self-review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No breaking changes
```

#### 2.2 Set up Branch Protection Rules
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Restrict direct pushes to main branch

### Task 3: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation (2.5 hours)

#### 3.1 Create GitHub Actions Workflow
Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        echo "Running unit tests..."
        # Add your test commands here
    - name: Run linting
      run: |
        echo "Running code linting..."
        # Add your linting commands here
```

#### 3.2 Implement Quality Gates
- Code coverage thresholds (minimum 80%)
- Security scanning with CodeQL
- Dependency vulnerability checks
- Performance regression testing

### Task 4: Team Collaboration Tools (1 hour)

#### 4.1 Set up Project Management
- Create GitHub Projects board
- Define issue templates
- Set up automated issue labeling
- Configure milestone tracking

#### 4.2 Documentation Standards
- Create CONTRIBUTING.md
- Set up API documentation with OpenAPI
- Implement changelog generation
- Create deployment runbooks
