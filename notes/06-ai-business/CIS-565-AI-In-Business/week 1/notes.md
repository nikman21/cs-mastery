# Week 1 Introduction to AI and its Foundations

## 1.1 What is AI?

- "The science and engineering of making intelligent machines" - John McCarthy

- "A machines's ability to perform the cognitive functions we associate with humans minds, such as perceiving, reasoning, learning, interacting with an enviroment, problem solving, exercising creativity"

### Human Approach

- System that think like humans

- System that act like humans

### Ideal Approach?

- Systems that think rationally

- Systems that act rationally

## 1.2 Types of AI, Part 1

### ANI?

Artificial Narrow Intelligence
    - AI that is "weak" or limited in scope
    - Examples:
        - Self Driving Cars, its narrowed in the sense that its focuses just on the scope of driving the car safely
        - Instagram - Ad algorithm that reccomend the best ads for the user

- My takeaway with ANI is that it ai made for a specific task its narrow in scope

## 1.3 Types of AI, Part 2

### Generative AI

- A special case of ANI that is focused on predicting and generating text, image, video, or sound output

- Generative AI Examples:
  - Text to Text:
        - ChatGPT(OpenAi)
        - Google Bard
        - NotionAI
  - Text to Image:
        - DALL-E (OpenAI)
        - Midjourney
        - Stable Diffusion
  - Text to Video:
        - Pika Labs
        - Meta (Make-A-Video)
        - Canva (Magic Media)
- Gen Ai is getting so much attention because it understands human language and computer language so essientially that being said if you can describe it then ai can build it.

## 1.4 Types of AI, Part 3

### Large Language Models

- LLMS:
  - Designed to understand and generate langauge
  - Trained on a massive corpus of text data

### AGI?

- Artificial General Intelligence:
  - "a theoretical AI form where a machine has intelligence equal to humans. It includes self-aware consciousness, the ability to solce coginitive abilities as a human across a range of domains such as natural language processing, reasoning, planning, knowledge representation, and learning." - IBM

### ASI?

- Artifcial Super Intelligence
  - A theoretical AI form where a machine has intelligence that surpasses that of humans, AGI but much more powerful

## 1.5 Machine Learning Basics

- A branch of artificial intelligence and computer scinece which focueses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn.
- Algorithms that learn directly from data.

- Two Main Tasks:
  1. Pattern recognition for description & understanding, organization within the original data, (unsupervised learning)
  2. Pattern recoginition for prediction of an outcome, prediction or classification outside the original data (supervised learning)

## 1.6 Machine Learning, Unsupervised learing

- Types of unsupervised learning:
  - Clustering
  - Association Rule Learning
  - Principle Component Analysis
  - Anomaly Detection

## 1.7 Machine Learning, Supervised Learning

- Supervised learning is used to predict both Continuous & Categorical outcomes

## 1.8 Machine Learning, Transparent Algorithms

- Some machine learning algorithms are transparent in the sense that you readily "see" into the model to understand what it is producing

## 1.9 Machine Learning, Blackbox Algorithms
